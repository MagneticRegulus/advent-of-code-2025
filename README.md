# advent-of-code-2025

This is a repo for Advent of Code 2025.

This year, I decided to complete the calendar in Ruby, my first programming language. I haven't programmed in Ruby in years, so this will be a lot of fun. Of course, my rustiness will show!

**This is not intended to be a showcase of my programming skills; it's just some fun for a few days!**

### Day 2

Had a lot of fun with part one as I found an algorithm which really sped up the program run time, but it was less practical for part 2. There is another algorithm *there* for part 2, I just hadn't quite figured it out yet.

### Day 4

I wrote some terribly inefficient (and I *mean* inefficient) ruby code for this one because I wanted to play around with ruby classes again. Mistake. It worked...it just took 17 minutes 25 seconds. If I had more time, I would have made it much faster.

I must remember to do things more simply tomorrow!
