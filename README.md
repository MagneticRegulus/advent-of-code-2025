# advent-of-code-2025

This is a repo for Advent of Code 2025.

This year, I decided to complete the calendar in Ruby, my first programming language. I haven't programmed in Ruby in years, so this will be a lot of fun. Of course, my rustiness will show!

### Day 2

Had a lot of fun with part one as I found an algorithm which really sped up the program run time, but it was less practical for part 2. There is another algorithm *there* for part 2, I just hadn't quite figured it out yet.
